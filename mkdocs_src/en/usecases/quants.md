# Quants & Researchers

For quantitative analysts and researchers who prioritize statistical rigor and want systematic optimization and walk-forward validation.

## Quantitative Evaluation Features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Walk-Forward Validation** | Automatic IS/OOS splits to detect overfitting |
| **Optuna Optimization** | Bayesian search over parameter space (200–1000 trials) |
| **Multiple Objectives** | Choose from Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, Calmar ratio, etc. |
| **Reproducibility** | Lock seeds and config in JSON for fully reproducible experiments |
| **Journal Logging** | All experiment results automatically recorded as JSON/CSV |

## Typical Research Workflow

```bash
# 1. Declare hypothesis in JSON
forge strategy create regime_test --template hmm_bb_rsi

# 2. Grid search over multiple parameters
forge optimize grid QQQ --strategy regime_test \
  --param rsi_period 10 14 20 \
  --param bb_period 15 20 25

# 3. Walk-forward validation (5 folds)
forge optimize walk-forward QQQ --strategy regime_test --folds 5

# 4. Save experiment to journal
forge journal record regime_test --note "HMM period sensitivity analysis"
```

## Evaluating Overfitting Risk

AlphaForge provides walk-forward testing (WFT) as a standard feature. A large IS/OOS performance degradation suggests overfitting.

```
IS Period  OOS Period  Sharpe(IS)  Sharpe(OOS)  Degradation
2020-22    2023        1.8         1.4          22%  ← acceptable
2020-22    2023        2.5         0.3          88%  ← likely overfit
```
