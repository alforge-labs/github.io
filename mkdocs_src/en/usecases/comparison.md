## AlphaForge vs Backtrader

### Backtrader's Strengths

Backtrader is a mature, event-driven backtesting framework.

- **High customizability** — Complex order logic (OCO, trailing stops, etc.) can be flexibly implemented in Python
- **Live trading support** — Direct broker connections including Interactive Brokers
- **Community and track record** — Years of real-world use with abundant code examples

### Backtrader's Limitations

- Event-driven simulation (bar-by-bar processing) is significantly slower than vectorbt
- Bayesian optimization and walk-forward validation are not built-in and require custom implementation
- No Pine Script generation; TradingView integration requires separate work
- Not designed with AI agent integration in mind

### When to Choose Which

| Choose AlphaForge | Choose Backtrader |
|----------------|----------------|
| You want fast optimization cycles | You need complex order logic (OCO, trailing stops, etc.) |
| You want systematic walk-forward validation | You need direct broker connections (e.g., Interactive Brokers) |
| You want TradingView alerts with automated order execution | You have an existing Backtrader codebase |
| You want to automate strategy exploration with Claude Code | You need precise event-driven control over execution logic |

## AlphaForge vs vectorbt Standalone

### About vectorbt

AlphaForge **uses vectorbt internally**. This means vectorbt is not a competitor — it's a foundational component of AlphaForge.

Strengths of using vectorbt standalone:

- **Fastest backtesting** — NumPy-based vectorized computation for massive datasets in seconds
- **Maximum flexibility** — Custom indicators and complex conditions written freely in Python
- **Seamless library integration** — Works naturally with Pandas, Matplotlib, and other Python tools

### What AlphaForge Adds on Top of vectorbt

| vectorbt Standalone | AlphaForge (vectorbt + Integration Layer) |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Strategy defined in Python code | Strategy defined in JSON (easy Git management) |
| Optimization requires custom implementation | Bayesian optimization via Optuna in a single CLI command |
| Walk-forward testing requires custom implementation | Walk-forward validation built-in |
| No Pine Script generation | Automatically generates Pine Script v6 from optimized parameters |
| No journal functionality | Experiment results automatically recorded as JSON/CSV |
| AI agent integration is non-standard | JSON-driven design makes it easy for Claude Code and others to read/write |

### When to Choose Which

Use vectorbt directly when you're developing custom indicators or doing exploratory analysis with Python APIs. Choose AlphaForge when you want to repeatedly run the full pipeline: backtesting → optimization → WFT → Pine Script generation.

## AlphaForge vs TradingView Standalone

### TradingView's Strengths

TradingView excels as a charting and community platform.

- **Real-time charts and rich indicators** — Industry-standard visual environment used by traders worldwide
- **Pine Script community** — Thousands of published scripts to instantly use and adapt
- **Alerts and Webhooks** — Automatic Webhook notifications when conditions trigger
- **Ease of use** — Chart analysis without programming experience

### TradingView Standalone Limitations

- Pine Script backtesting offers basic functionality without Bayesian optimization or WFT
- Parameter exploration (testing many combinations) is impractical in a browser environment
- Managing experiment reproducibility (tracking which parameters were tested) is difficult

### AlphaForge and TradingView Are Complementary

AlphaForge and TradingView are **not competitors — they work together**.

```
AlphaForge: backtest and optimize strategy
  ↓
forge command: automatically generate Pine Script v6
  ↓
Paste into TradingView for real-time monitoring
  ↓
Condition triggers → TradingView alert → AlphaStrike executes order automatically
```

For TradingView users, AlphaForge acts as a "scientific factory for creating Pine Scripts." See the [TradingView Users Guide](tradingview.md) for details.

## AlphaForge vs Manual Python Notebooks

### Python Notebook Strengths

Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab are excellent for exploratory analysis.

- **Immediate feedback** — Run cells one at a time to quickly validate ideas
- **Visualization** — Rich inline charts with Matplotlib, Plotly, and others
- **Freedom** — Combine any library you want

### Challenges with Manual Notebooks

| Challenge | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reproducibility** | Changing cell execution order or variable state changes results |
| **Parameter tracking** | Difficult to track "which settings produced good results" |
| **Automation barrier** | Separate infrastructure needed to run notebooks automatically overnight |
| **Git management** | .ipynb file diffs are hard to read and difficult to review |
| **AI agent integration** | Inefficient for Claude Code to read/write notebook state |

### How to Use Each

Notebooks are ideal for the **early exploration phase** of an idea. Once an idea solidifies and you want to "systematically optimize, validate, and reproduce" it, migrating to a JSON strategy in AlphaForge makes management and automation straightforward.

## Why CLI + JSON Strategy?

Here's why AlphaForge defines strategies in JSON rather than Python code.

### Reason 1: Complete Reproducibility via Git

```json
{
  "strategy": "cl_hmm_bb_rsi_v1",
  "symbol": "CL=F",
  "params": {
    "hmm_states": 3,
    "bb_period": 20,
    "rsi_period": 14,
    "rsi_upper": 65
  },
  "seed": 42
}
```

Commit this JSON and anyone, at any time, on any machine can reproduce **exactly the same result**. This reproducibility — difficult to achieve with notebooks that mix code and parameters — is what JSON delivers.

### Reason 2: Natural Fit for AI Agents

AI agents like Claude Code can naturally read and write JSON files. This enables:

- AI to autonomously create and modify strategies
- AI to analyze backtest results and suggest next parameters
- Overnight loops exploring hundreds of strategies automatically

See the [AI Agent Users Guide](ai-agents.md) for details.

### Reason 3: Separation of Noise and Signal

Separating strategy logic (code) from parameters (values) means:

- Parameter change reviews become easy (diffs are readable)
- A/B testing (same logic, different parameters) can be managed explicitly
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines is straightforward

---

## Why Walk-Forward Validation?

### The Overfitting (Curve-Fitting) Risk

When you optimize parameters on backtest data, there's a risk of **overfitting to historical data**.

```
Problematic optimization flow:
All historical data → Parameter optimization → Backtest on same data
                                                ↑ Optimizing with "knowledge" of the past
```

This approach can make non-functional parameters appear "excellent."

### What Walk-Forward Validation Is

Walk-Forward Testing (WFT) splits time-series data into **In-Sample (IS) training periods and Out-of-Sample (OOS) validation periods**:

```
WFT structure (5-fold example):
IS: 2018-2020  → Optimize → Validate on OOS: 2021
IS: 2019-2021  → Optimize → Validate on OOS: 2022
IS: 2020-2022  → Optimize → Validate on OOS: 2023
IS: 2021-2023  → Optimize → Validate on OOS: 2024
IS: 2022-2024  → Optimize → Validate on OOS: 2025

→ Aggregate 5 OOS periods = True generalization performance
```

### Running WFT in AlphaForge

```bash
# Run 5-fold walk-forward validation with a single command
forge optimize walk-forward CL=F --strategy cl_hmm_bb_rsi_v1 --folds 5
```

A large gap between IS and OOS Sharpe ratios suggests overfitting:

```
IS Period  OOS Period  Sharpe(IS)  Sharpe(OOS)  Assessment
2020-22    2023        1.8         1.4          22% drop → acceptable
2020-22    2023        2.5         0.3          88% drop → likely overfit
```

## Summary: Which Tool Should You Choose?

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| You need precise event-driven control over complex order logic | Backtrader |
| You want to work directly with NumPy-level fast computation | vectorbt standalone |
| You want real-time charts and community strategy access | TradingView |

| You want end-to-end management: backtest → optimize → WFT → Pine Script → auto-execution | **AlphaForge** |
| You want to automate strategy exploration with AI agents | **AlphaForge** |
| You want to enhance TradingView with scientific backtesting | **AlphaForge + TradingView** |

AlphaForge is not a "do-everything" universal tool. If you need complex event-driven logic or direct connections to specific brokers, consider combining with other tools.
