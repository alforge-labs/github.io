# alpha-visualizer

**alpha-visualizer** is the **OSS package that visualizes AlphaForge backtest results in your web browser** — outputs from `alpha-forge backtest run` and friends. It reads `backtest_results.db` (SQLite) and strategy JSON files directly, so it works on hosts without `alpha-forge` installed.

!!! tip "How it connects to AlphaForge"
    Run `alpha-forge backtest run <SYMBOL> --strategy <id>` and the CLI ends with "📊 You can review the chart with `alpha-vis serve`". That message is the entry point to alpha-visualizer, which renders the same result as **Equity / Drawdown / trades / metric comparisons in a browser**. AlphaForge itself is commercial, but the result-visualization layer is open source. See [Getting Started → Next steps: Visualize](../getting-started.md#next-steps-visualize) and the [End-to-End Strategy Workflow](../guides/end-to-end-workflow.md) for the first integration steps.
