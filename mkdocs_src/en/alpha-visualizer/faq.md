# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Installation & startup

### `vis: command not found`

When installed via `uv tool install`, your shell must include uv's tool directory in `PATH`.

```bash
# Check uv tool dir
uv tool dir
# Verify $HOME/.local/bin is on PATH
echo $PATH

# If missing
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### `backtest_results.db` not found / no strategies shown

`vis serve` may not see `<forge-dir>/data/results/backtest_results.db`.

```bash
# Inspect resolved paths (printed at startup)
vis serve --forge-dir <path>

# Verify directly
ls <path>/data/results/backtest_results.db
ls <path>/data/strategies/
```

If you have never executed `forge backtest run`, `backtest_results.db` does not exist yet. Run at least one backtest before launching `vis serve`.

### Port already in use

```
[Errno 48] Address already in use: 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Pick another port or stop the conflicting process.

```bash
vis serve --port 9000

# Inspect what is using port 8000
lsof -i :8000
```

### Browser does not open automatically

If you did not pass `--no-open` and the browser still does not open, your environment may suppress automatic browser launch (common on WSL / headless servers). Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000> manually.

## Behavior

### Stale results after a new run

Reload the dashboard with `Cmd+R` / `F5` after `forge backtest run`. Auto-reload is not implemented.

### Strategy name shows `undefined`

The strategy JSON may be missing a `name` field, or `latest_*` metrics may not have been computed yet. Recent versions (v0.1.1+) guard against undefined values — try `pip install --upgrade alpha-visualizer`.

### Compare correlation heatmap doesn't render

If selected strategies have **no overlapping trade period**, correlation cannot be computed. Pick strategies with overlapping date ranges.

## Remote / production

### Access from another machine

```bash
vis serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then:

- Open the relevant port on your firewall
- Prefer SSH port-forwarding or VPN over public exposure (no built-in auth)

### HTTPS

There is no built-in TLS. Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (nginx / Caddy / Cloudflare Tunnel).

### Adding authentication

No built-in auth. Add Basic auth, OAuth Proxy, Tailscale Auth, etc. at the reverse proxy layer.

## Versions & compatibility

### Compatible `forge` versions

`alpha-visualizer` reads `backtest_results.db` (SQLite) and strategy JSON. See the CHANGELOG or [Releases](https://github.com/alforge-labs/alpha-visualizer/releases) for compatibility windows.

### Running on Python 3.11 or older

Python 3.12+ is required. Older versions are not supported.
