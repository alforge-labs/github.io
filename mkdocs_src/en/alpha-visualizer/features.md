Walkthrough of each dashboard screen served by `vis serve`.

Strategy library with search. Includes the Symbol Atlas grouped by asset class, Saved Views (preset filters), and a groupable Strategy Ledger.

Key actions:

- Filter by symbol / timeframe / Sharpe tier
- Save your favorite filter combinations as Saved Views
- Open the global command palette with `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`
- Click a row to expand the slide panel, or jump to Detail

`selectedId` and `compareIds` are synchronized to URL query parameters, so a particular selection state can be shared via URL.

## Cross-cutting features

### Global search (Cmd+K)

`Cmd+K` (macOS) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows / Linux) opens a command palette from any screen, letting you jump by strategy name or screen name.

### Theme toggle

Top-right toggle switches between dark and light. Preference is stored in browser localStorage.

### Language toggle

Switch UI between Japanese and English — useful for screenshots or sharing with international teammates.

### Export

- **CSV** — download trade history / metric tables from any panel
- **PNG** — save charts as static images
- **URL share** — Browse / Compare selection state is synced to query string, so copying the URL shares the view
